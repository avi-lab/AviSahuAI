Our  <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">MISSION</span> is to enhance understanding and treatment of cancer by harnessing the power of computer intelligence. Guided by our vision that computers will be able think and do just as humans can, we strive to develop cutting-edge AI and statistical approaches to build systems models of tumors, and collaborate with experimental labs and pharma companies to achieve our mission. Our lab fosters a diverse, collaborative environment for advancing cancer research.

We're thrilled to announce the release of our latest preprint in collaboration with Lab of Rafa Irizarry! We've developed a principled approach, scDist, to tackle the challenge of individual and cohort variability in single-cell data. As the adoption of single-cell technologies grows, the importance of rigorous and principled approaches to handle the resulting data variation cannot be overstated. It's crucial for improving the accuracy of our findings and reducing false positives. Adoption of this rigrous tool allowed us to detect robust perturbations in DC, pDC, and NK cells in COVID-19 and immunotherapy treatment responses.As single-cell datasets continue to expand, we believe that there is even more work to be done by those are passionate about the intersection of AI, statistics, and biology. With collective effort and open discussion, we can drive this field forward. Let's make a difference together!

Our lab is dedicated to developing innovative therapies and identifying predictive biomarkers for late-stage cancers. Using AI and statistical approaches, we explore three key areas: factors that contribute to tumor microenvironments, the potential for reversal, and the patients who could benefit. Our research programs include developing new immunotherapies, single-cell analysis, and AI-based predictors for immunomodulatory drugs. Our ultimate goal is to design new immunotherapies for advanced cancer patients and tailor our models to pediatric cancers and minority populations.
