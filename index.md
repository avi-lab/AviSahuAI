Our  <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">MISSION</span> is to enhance understanding and treatment of cancer by harnessing the power of computer intelligence. Guided by our vision that computers will be able think and do just as humans can, we strive to develop cutting-edge AI and statistical approaches to build systems models of tumors, and collaborate with experimental labs and pharma companies to achieve our mission. Our lab fosters a diverse, collaborative environment for advancing cancer research.

Our lab is dedicated to developing innovative therapies and identifying predictive biomarkers for late-stage cancers. Using AI and statistical approaches, we explore three key areas: factors that contribute to tumor microenvironments, the potential for reversal, and the patients who could benefit. Our research programs include developing new immunotherapies, single-cell analysis, and AI-based predictors for immunomodulatory drugs. Our ultimate goal is to design new immunotherapies for advanced cancer patients and tailor our models to pediatric cancers and minority populations.
